## About Me
Hey there, I'm Kevin! Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by all things tech. That's why I decided to major in Math-CS – it's been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. Whether it's building computers or crafting software programs, I'm passionate about creating user-friendly apps that become a part of our daily lives. My time at the __University of California, San Diego *(UCSD)*__ has been incredible. It's been the perfect place for me to explore my interests in mathematics and computer science. At UCSD, I've had the chance to dive into the inner workings of computers, learn from amazing professors, and dive into hands-on projects that have really deepened my understanding of this exciting field. Sure, the academic challenges have been tough, but they've also helped me grow and become a more confident software engineer. Outside of classes, I've found an awesome coding community where I've made great friends and honed my programming skills through cool projects. UCSD has truly been the foundation of my growth – not just academically, but personally and professionally too. It's given me a supportive environment where I can explore my interests in the dynamic world of mathematics and computer science. As always,
